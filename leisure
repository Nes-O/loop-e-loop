Did the vscode setup for Dreamhouse project and my org login is failing. I am so tired. Tomorrow I have to travel to Kalighat temple and do paperwork
for my father and pack and so much of work. 
Growing up sucks, with bad breakups, tired mornings still wake up to attend office not giving up on coding because I dont want to fail
and taking care of mental health, worrying about my parents, and planning future.
