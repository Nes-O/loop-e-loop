Did the vscode setup for Dreamhouse project and my org login is failing. I am so tired. Tomorrow I have to travel to Kalighat temple and do paperwork
for my father and pack and so much of work. 
Growing up sucks, with bad breakups, tired mornings still wake up to attend office not giving up on coding because I dont want to fail
and taking care of mental health, worrying about my parents, and planning future.

Working on share certificates, packing for tomorrow going back to bangalore this time for better. 
Tonight was bright moon and guru purnima. It was so peaceful to stay in home sometimes though there were bitter stuffs.
I am grateful to my parents and sister who revived me up from everything.

Just travelled around and walked around in the old bangalore places. Visited aquarium, cubbon park. It didnot really feel bad to travel alone 
Did miss my ex a bit but then he didnt really like travelling in crowded places. So thats fine.
umm you should really go to Kolkata zoo once the variety is really amazing . The sheer fear it used to cause in that crocodile zone ... 
Will do the code submits from tomorrow. I am too tired now .
