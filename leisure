Working on share certificates

19-07-2024
Did the vscode setup for Dreamhouse project and my org login is failing. I am so tired. Tomorrow I have to travel to Kalighat temple and do paperwork
for my father and pack and so much of work. 
Growing up sucks, with bad breakups, tired mornings still wake up to attend office not giving up on coding because I dont want to fail
and taking care of mental health, worrying about my parents, and planning future.

Working on share certificates, packing for tomorrow going back to bangalore this time for better.

I am grateful to my parents and sister who revived me up from everything.

Just travelled around and walked around in the old bangalore places. Visited aquarium, cubbon park. It didnot really feel bad to travel alone 
Did miss my ex a bit but then he didnt really like travelling in crowded places. So thats fine.
umm you should really go to Kolkata zoo once the variety is really amazing . The sheer fear it used to cause in that crocodile zone ... 
Will do the code submits from tomorrow. I am too tired now .

Working on office jira, still today working on it.

12-08-2024
Have been working from 9:30 am with office work . I am tired af. This close to dropping dead with fever and literally 12 hr of screen sharing and 
debugging historical code. Missing my ex so much like so much. Had cried the whole day.

13-08-2024
I am working since, 9:30 am. I am too tired to even open laptop. 

14-08-2024
Its not that late and since last 4 days I havent made proper code submits. This time I made good progress with my office works and one who low key 
bothers me in office is moving to a different team. I would submit code tomorrow whole day and probably watch a movie. 

18-08-2024
Played badminton , working on office stuff. Things are looking good. Things are all ok now.

22-08-2024
I didnot have much work today, nor go for badminton today. I did start with dating, as I have to go ahead in my life. Cant stay in limbo waiting for good to happen.
I want to stay in strict discipline and even maintain a good life. I dont want to go back to old patterns. Look after my parents and make my parents happy. Work through
all my insecurities and do good stuff.
From Monday I promise to complete the resume and complete the adventurer rank. And move forward.

23-08-2024
So I came back from a date, and the guy was good only N----. To let you know got him from Hinge and it was all good all the conversations and alluntil I realised that 
I had serious period leaks happening. And I freaked out bad and was so fumbled up that wanted to run away untilhe spoke softly and said its chill and my whole dress was 
mostly covered with blood.

24-08-2024
Went on to another date, the guy was good too. He bought pink roses for me. I had written in diary about the pink roses so I dont know, there is not very much 
attraction and he is not looking for something serious. So I dont know whether to continue seeing him. I did feel bad and weird about not being with Vineeth. Maybe
look forward to second date. Lets see. S------ . Talking on with him 

25-08-2024
Another day another date, may be the guy was too bit full of himself. He did bring pack of 5 chocolates. I did talk something weird that made him feel bit weird and 
I feel its fine to not let my abandonment issues not to get the worse out of me. So that is not the person for you who cant give me reassurance or is bit too selfish.
So heal yourself, you will be fine for the rest of the stuffs dont worry much. M---- . I do feel bit weird after the bad date but then its ok . I shouldnt have gotten 
drunk. Its fine to ask for reassurance. So all good 

26-08-2024
In another day another date of mine, Ak--- . He was sober and still into me but wore his ex s ring to a date. and asked me if I would stop dating altogether.
I did find that nice and cute for him because he was bit afraid to lose me but then I felt too much of him. Maybe he is a genuine guy and he was and I understand where 
he is coming from, after getting out of a long term relationship people are afraid they would lose out on. 

27-08-2024
Met a guy called S------. Had very nice date with him, with lots of laughter, joy and fun. I am bit dicey about him because on paper he looks pretty good. 
I dont know what comes behind him.
Is it wrong to go with the flow with him. 

28-08-2024
Hi there its getting bit hectic with everything going on. I would agree that the crowd here is bit better than b----.
So everything is sort of trial and error and it needs to be like that. That is all sort ofthings happening and working. 
Now that there is whole set of dynamics going round. So dont worry things would have been eventually gone like this
probably and when things with Vineeth ended on 8th March as sign of destruction on shiv ratra. Things are all going out
in good way. 

1-09-2024
Hi there I am stuck at badminton court for 2 hrs, I will go back and complete my resume as I promised. 

2-09-2024
I am willing to put out to do the stuff. I again made Antara text Vineeth and this time though I expected it was way worse.
But then again I am over it now. Like it feels like a day to day job now. Earlier I had a feeling of loss but then again 
as day passes it feels all was better in my favour. I thank god its over for good. 

4-09-24
Its been a good day at work with everything.

5-09-2024
Stuck at work with custom metadata. Could complete it . Would write complete about it. 

10-09-24
Working since 9am . Seniority !!!!

11-09-24
Things are going great at work so will the family front and I will meet the love of my life. It will be serene
peace no confusion and just all good.
The more I think about my relationship with Vin I realise I started loving him a month later after breaking up. Uptil
that time it was attachment, addiction, convinience, trying to prove people, trying to get my self esteem high after 
being treated like shitt by Am---. 
The more I understood about how I hurt Vin the more things started settling down it started easing up and knowing that
he didnt have to go through that and if I loved him enough I would let him just leave and let him find his peace away from me.
I did definitely grieve the end of that relation, never was I as close to anybody like him and the constant doubting that
is it too good to be true made me self sabotage the things I prayed for. 
I never understood the meaning of the phrase when I read that 'Love is expansive'.
I could never really feel love, I always doubted people for their intentions because I always thought I had to work for it.
I knwo it stems from my childhood traumas and sometimes I am grateful for the experience and sometimes sad. 
I prayed for salvation of my mistakes as well as his. 
But then other times I do realise that he was all along since day 1 discussing everything with his friends all my 
whereabouts with his friends and every step that he was taking his friends were also suggesting him stuff which kind of 
made him ugly inside out (though I dont normally use these phrases for people). He discussed with his friends what to do 
and what not to do and how to show masculanity so I believe I left that with minimum casuality.
I know that he wont have spine to even get it inhis head with his share of stuff because that takes courage. 
He couldnt even properly reply back to his manager let alone life challenging things. So its better done and gone than be 
in a miserable, lazy, effortless relationship.

13-09-24
I delivered work this sprint with my responsibility led the team. I am looking forward to doing so much better
coding wise work wise and leading teams.

14-09-24
1st interview in almost 3 yrs for salesforce developer. It was bit fumbling but it went okish, I knew stuff TCS 
so good enough.

15-09-24
I went to Debanj--- place and her one other friend . For some reason it felt different like not what I had felt 
kind of weird energy and it was all smooth.

16-09-24
I got stood up in a date. All time low on my confidence. But my existensial crisis got over when one office colleague
keeps on pestering me all day while, her frustration keeps on increasing with every minute after 6 pm.

17-09-24
I am handling this sprints complete work starting from data creation and cleaning to raising pr and cors.

20-09-24
Time flies so fast that it doesnot really make sense hoe 8 months passed away. I saw the inner meanings of Krishna Raas Leela
and I dont realise still today was it all staged and planned for certain redirections and healings that wouldnt have happened 
and occured. I didnt even realise why tears came tricking down and why hadnt I heard something so pure and blissful like the
bhagwatm before.

21-09-24
I missed Vin today, thoda zyada than the previous days. I went out on a date with Ansh. It was good. The drinks, the talks
I miss Vin's smell though. Too drunk to write codes today

24-09-24
Couple of days at Suds place was so good. Cooked, ate and mostly slept in here and so much of talks and conversations. 
So it was good and with Glenfidich.

26-09-24
I went to TechSparks today. It was amazing, so worth my 2500. Idiot me missed the 25 yesterdays git submit.
27-09-24
I promise on completing 3000 rank in adventurer after the tech event.
28-09-24
I am talking to Up. but as I talk to her she tells me how she feels so pressurised to get married with S.... da even though
they are engaged for over 2 yrs and had gotten registry. I wish I could make ever Vin understand what I felt when his 
parents came to my place and the pressure of marriage that comes with it to do everything correct and the responsibilities. 
How everything revolves around marriage for a girl and how it is an accomplishment. I thought it was different with me, 
because me and Vin had just met 6 months back and the things fastracked. But its a commitment for life and everybody freaks 
out at it even for people who stay in live-in for 4 yrs. 

2-10-24
As I go ahead, there are flashbacks and horrible mental picture of the night of 8-03-24. It took a lot from my end to
be where I am now with meditation, running I am doing so much better than what the last 2 yrs has been for me.
I from now on accept to surrender. The goods, the bads. Last two years I had prayed so much about how to make me courageous,
fearless strong in workplace, efficient. Now that all of it coming step by step it came with a price to it. It came at
a cost and a price to pay.
