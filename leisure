Working on share certificates

19-07-2024
Did the vscode setup for Dreamhouse project and my org login is failing. I am so tired. Tomorrow I have to travel to Kalighat temple and do paperwork
for my father and pack and so much of work. 
Growing up sucks, with bad breakups, tired mornings still wake up to attend office not giving up on coding because I dont want to fail
and taking care of mental health, worrying about my parents, and planning future.

Working on share certificates, packing for tomorrow going back to bangalore this time for better. 
Tonight was bright moon and guru purnima. It was so peaceful to stay in home sometimes though there were bitter stuffs.
I am grateful to my parents and sister who revived me up from everything.

Just travelled around and walked around in the old bangalore places. Visited aquarium, cubbon park. It didnot really feel bad to travel alone 
Did miss my ex a bit but then he didnt really like travelling in crowded places. So thats fine.
umm you should really go to Kolkata zoo once the variety is really amazing . The sheer fear it used to cause in that crocodile zone ... 
Will do the code submits from tomorrow. I am too tired now .

Working on office jira, still today working on it.

12-08-2024
Have been working from 9:30 am with office work . I am tired af. This close to dropping dead with fever and literally 12 hr of screen sharing and 
debugging historical code. Missing my ex so much like so much. Had cried the whole day.

13-08-2024
I am working since, 9:30 am. I am too tired to even open laptop. 

14-08-2024
Its not that late and since last 4 days I havent made proper code submits. This time I made good progress with my office works and one who low key 
bothers me in office is moving to a different team. I would submit code tomorrow whole day and probably watch a movie. 

18-08-2024
Played badminton , working on office stuff. Things are looking good. Things are all ok now.

22-08-2024
I didnot have much work today, nor go for badminton today. I did start with dating, as I have to go ahead in my life. Cant stay in limbo waiting for good to happen.
I want to stay in strict discipline and even maintain a good life. I dont want to go back to old patterns. Look after my parents and make my parents happy. Work through
all my insecurities and do good stuff.
From Monday I promise to complete the resume and complete the adventurer rank. And move forward.

23-08-2024
So I came back from a date, and the guy was good only N----. To let you know got him from Hinge and it was all good all the conversations and alluntil I realised that 
I had serious period leaks happening. And I freaked out bad and was so fumbled up that wanted to run away untilhe spoke softly and said its chill and my whole dress was 
mostly covered with blood.

24-08-2024
Went on to another date, the guy was good too. He bought pink roses for me. I had written in diary about the pink roses so I dont know, there is not very much 
attraction and he is not looking for something serious. So I dont know whether to continue seeing him. I did feel bad and weird about not being with Vineeth. Maybe
look forward to second date. Lets see. S------ . Talking on with him 

25-08-2024
Another day another date, may be the guy was too bit full of himself. He did bring pack of 5 chocolates. I did talk something weird that made him feel bit weird and 
I feel its fine to not let my abandonment issues not to get the worse out of me. So that is not the person for you who cant give me reassurance or is bit too selfish.
So heal yourself, you will be fine for the rest of the stuffs dont worry much. M---- . I do feel bit weird after the bad date but then its ok . I shouldnt have gotten 
drunk. Its fine to ask for reassurance. So all good 

26-08-2024
In another day another date of mine, Ak--- . He was sober and still into me but wore his ex s ring to a date. and asked me if I would stop dating altogether.
I did find that nice and cute for him because he was bit afraid to lose me but then I felt too much of him. Maybe he is a genuine guy and he was and I understand where 
he is coming from, after getting out of a long term relationship people are afraid they would lose out on. 

27-08-2024
Met a guy called S------. Had very nice date with him, with lots of laughter, joy and fun. I am bit dicey about him because on paper he looks pretty good. 
I dont know what comes behind him.
Is it wrong to go with the flow with him. 

28-08-2024
Hi there its getting bit hectic with everything going on. I would agree that the crowd here is bit better than b----.
So everything is sort of trial and error and it needs to be like that. That is all sort ofthings happening and working. 
Now that there is whole set of dynamics going round. So dont worry things would have been eventually gone like this
probably and when things with Vineeth ended on 8th March as sign of destruction on shiv ratra. Things are all going out
in good way. 

1-09-2024
Hi there I am stuck at badminton court for 2 hrs, I will go back and complete my resume as I promised. 

2-09-2024
I am willing to put out to do the stuff. I again made Antara text Vineeth and this time though I expected it was way worse.
But then again I am over it now. Like it feels like a day to day job now. Earlier I had a feeling of loss but then again 
as day passes it feels all was better in my favour. I thank god its over for good.
