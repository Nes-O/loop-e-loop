Did the vscode setup for Dreamhouse project and my org login is failing. I am so tired. Tomorrow I have to travel to Kalighat temple and do paperwork
for my father and pack and so much of work. 
Growing up sucks, with bad breakups, tired mornings still wake up to attend office not giving up on coding because I dont want to fail
and taking care of mental health, worrying about my parents, and planning future.

I am grateful to my parents and sister who revived me up from everything.

Just travelled around and walked around in the old bangalore places. Visited aquarium, cubbon park. It didnot really feel bad to travel alone 
Did miss my ex a bit but then he didnt really like travelling in crowded places. So thats fine.
umm you should really go to Kolkata zoo once the variety is really amazing . The sheer fear it used to cause in that crocodile zone ... 
Will do the code submits from tomorrow. I am too tired now .

Have been working from 9:30 am with office work . I am tired af. This close to dropping dead with fever and literally 12 hr of screen sharing and 
debugging historical code. Missing my ex so much like so much. Had cried the whole day.

Its not that late and since last 4 days I havent made proper code submits. This time I made good progress with my office works and one who low key 
bothers me in office is moving to a different team. I would submit code tomorrow whole day and probably watch a movie.

Played badminton , working on office stuff. Things are looking good. Things are all ok now.

22-08-2024
I didnot have much work today, nor go for badminton today. I did start with dating, as I have to go ahead in my life. Cant stay in limbo waiting for good to happen.
I want to stay in strict discipline and even maintain a good life. I dont want to go back to old patterns. Look after my parents and make my parents happy. Work through
all my insecurities and do good stuff.
From Monday I promise to complete the resume and complete the adventurer rank. And move forward.

So I came back from a date, and the guy was good only N----. To let you know got him from Hinge and it was all good all the conversations and alluntil I realised that 
I had serious period leaks happening. And I freaked out bad and was so fumbled up that wanted to run away untilhe spoke softly and said its chilland my whole dress was 
mostly covered with blood.
